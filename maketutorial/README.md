**`Makefile` tutorial**

- The `-o` flag tells the compiler to give the executable an alternative name. Otherwise, the default name is `a.out`.
- The `./` simply tells your shell to search the current directory for the executable, rather than its normal executable paths.
- The flag `-save-temps` tells the compiler to retain the temporary files it makes when we compile our program
- The `-c` flag specifies making an object file
